### Hello! ✨

I'm Nina (she/her), a PhD student at the University of Bristol.  
My research is in the field of mental health data science, which uses data science methods to understand mental health better.  

You'll find the work on my profile falls into three categories:  
- research software for running studies (usually in Python 🐍)  
- data analysis (usually in R 🏴‍☠️ )  
- manuscripts and reports (usually in .Rmd or LaTeX)  

I also spend a lot of time working on repositories on [my lab group's page](https://github.com/DynamicGenetics), where you'll find more work on webapps, and with [Data Ethics Club](https://github.com/very-good-science/data-ethics-club) where you'll find our lovely community of ethics-inclined data people! 

Please feel free to email me, find me on Twitter or have a look at my website.
